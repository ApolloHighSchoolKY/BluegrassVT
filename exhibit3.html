					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic17.jpg" alt="" /></span>In 1965, Carlton Haney presented the first multi-day, outdoor bluegrass festival at a horse farm near Roanoke, Virginia. On the last day of the event, Haney narrated the story of bluegrass, centering upon Bill Monroe and musicians who had worked with him. The event came at a low point in bluegrass music's popularity. However, by 1970, outdoor bluegrass festivals were staged all over North America; soon they would extend to other continents. No longer reliant upon country and folk infrastructure, a worldwide bluegrass community coalesced, with its own publications, radio programs, record companies, and instrument makers, as well as new trade and fan organizations.</p>

					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic20.jpg" alt="" /></span>Bluegrass is acoustic music, natural music! How appropriate that it has found a happy home in nature, tented under trees, stars, sunshine, and- strange how often!- soggy skies. Festivals have been central to bluegrass music since the 1960s. Many Americans with enough leisure time, pocket money, and good cars and RVs, drawn on by the lure of a great Interstate highway system, hit the road in search of their music. During the good-weather months, one can almost always find a bluegrass festival within driving distance, in almost all parts of the country.</p>

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic19.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><br>The notion of a "home" for bluegrass didn't get much traction until the middle 1980s, almost a half-century after Bill Monroe started putting the style together. Monroe was born and raised less than 40 miles from Owensboro in nearby Rosine, Kentucky. Terry Woodward and other civic leaders were exploring ways to develop the community and encourage people to visit. Before long, the brand new International Bluegrass Music Association established its first headquarters in Owensboro (1985). An annual trade exposition (1987) and awards show for the music industry (1990) were also established. The International Bluegrass Music Museum soon followed, in 1991.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
