Continue your pilgrimage to the second floor for the International Bluegrass Music Association Hall of Fame, Video Oral History, and temporary galleries.</p>

					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic21.jpg" alt="" /></span>The bluegrass guitar style started to emerge with the first commercial performances of old-time instrumental music. Groups and individual artists such as J .E. Mainer and his Mountaineers, Gid Tanner and The Skillet Lickers, Charlie Poole, The Carter Family, Jimmie Rodgers, and The Delmore Brothers, are all good examples of what is essentially the same style of guitar playing that we know so well today. There are many records available of these early country musicians in which the simple boom-chicka boom-chicka rhythm and strong bass runs can be clearly heard. The style is simple and direct, but perfectly suited to the straight-forward music it accompanies.</p>

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic26.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><br>Bluegrass music is a direct descendant of the old-time string band tradition, which in turn developed out of southern mountain dance music and songs. The southern mountains have been a vast repository of traditional music since the 17th century when the hills were first settled by English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants who brought with them their incredibly rich ballad and song tradition. Isolated in the hills for generations, the music flourished almost unchanged until the early part of the twentieth century when the mountains became accessible to outside influence, making possible an exchange of musical (and other) ideas. Mountain music held on and grew despite the pressures from more socially acceptable forms of popular music, and although some change did occur, the rural people of the south and other parts of the country clung tenaciously to the music which has become one of the most valuable contributions to American culture. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
