  <h4>Market research in the new millennium disclosed that bluegrass was the most-liked music of 15.5 million Americans. Since the 1990s, use of the word “bluegrass” has evolved beyond earlier definitions. Interest in forms that came before bluegrass (“roots”) accompanies combinations with other styles, instruments, and techniques (“branches”). The term “big tent” was coined to embrace all these phenomena as bluegrass entered the digital and internet age. With early performers and fans passing from the scene, the music is now in the hands of new generations.</h4>
